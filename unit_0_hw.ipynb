The first block is a `markdown` block, that is where this text lives. Markdown is a industry standard formatting language often used in readme.md files (the .md stands for markdown). Markdown is great for explaining code blocks or adding a description under a block of code. You can look up different ways to format text in a markdown block online. You can also click this block to see how I formatted it. To see the formatted text you hit the Run All button on the top (assuming you are in VSCode). \n",
